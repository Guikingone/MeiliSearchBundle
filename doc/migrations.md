# Migrations (new in **0.2**)

This bundle provides an [IndexSynchronizer](../src/Index/IndexSynchronizer.php) which allows keeping
track of indexes synchronization between the MeiliSearch instance and the metadata registry.

A [DocumentMigrationOrchestrator](../src/Document/DocumentMigrationOrchestrator.php) is also provided
to help migrate documents between indexes.
